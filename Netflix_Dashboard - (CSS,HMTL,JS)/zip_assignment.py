This file is to check if the folder that the student is trying to submit
is of this exact structure (with exact naming):
| index.html
| data
    | *
| <all the other stuff that you included with no name requirements>
And then it will zip
This code is inspired by the submission zip file created by Professor
James Tompkin (james_topkin@brown.edu) for CSCI 1430 - Brown University.
