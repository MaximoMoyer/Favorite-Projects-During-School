# MyProjects

This is a repository that shows a small selection of my ML, Web Development/scraping, and multi-class Java projects. If I had to chose one project for you to click on it would be Bitcoin_Transaction_Prediction - this was a cool one!

## Projects in this repository

### ML

**Fire_Prediction - NaiveBayes_DecisionTree_HeatMap(Python)**

- Using National Fire Incident Reporting Systems Data, joined with the Virtual Weather Crossing API data, to determine what type of fire("Natural Vegetation", "Structural", "Vehicle") is most likely to occur given the weather.

**Bitcoin_Transaction_Prediction - word2vec_DeepWalks_TemporalTraining(Python)**

- Implimentation of a Georgia Tech paper: structured data classification problem, using blockchain data to build transaction networks and account embeddings and then forecasting transactions between accounts.

**Cancer_Prediction - Message_Passing_NN_On_Graphs(Python)**
- Under Construction

**Machine_Translation - LSTM&RNN(Python)**
- Under Construction

**Language_Model - Trigram&RNN(Python)**
- Under Construction

**Robot_Balance_Pole - Policy_Gradient_RL(Python)**
- Under Construction

### Web Dev/scraping

**Stock_DataBase_Maker - Web_Scraping&DataBase_Creation(Python/SQL)**
- Simple project that scrapes Yahoo Finance and pulls data from the IEX trading API to get information on various stocks. Also uses SQL to get various cuts of this data.

**Netflix_Dashboard - (CSS,HTML,JS)**
- This project took real Netflix data from Kaggle, and created an interactive dashboard using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Multi-Class Java:
**Graph - PageRank/PrimJarnik(Java)**
- This project creates a graph data strcuture from scratch and implements the pagerank (elementary search) algorithm and PrimJarnik (MST) algorithm on the graph.
