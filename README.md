# MyProjects

This is a repository that shows a small selection of my ML, Web Development/scraping, and multi-class Java projects.

## Projects in this repository

### ML

**Fire_Prediction - NaiveBayes_DecisionTree_HeatMap(Python)**

- Using National Fire Incident Reporting Systems Data, joined with the Virtual Weather Crossing API data, to determine what type of fire("Natural Vegetation", "Structural", "Vehicle") is most likely to occur given the weather.

**Bitcoin_Transaction_Prediction - word2vec_DeepWalks_TemporalTraining(Python)**

- Implimentation of a Georgia Tech paper: structured data classification problem, using blockchain data to build transaction networks and account embeddings and then forecasting transactions between accounts.
